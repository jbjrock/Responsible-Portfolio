            <p>I'm a native of North Carolina that's very eager to learn and grasp all of the concepts
                of Web Development! I have always been a very tech savvy individual but learning these 
                fundamentals may be challening but I'm up for the test!
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time I enjoying destroying people on NBA 2k! My skill set is undeniable when
                it comes to that game. Outside of that you can catch me spending time with my amazing wife, 
                working out and traveling with time permits.
